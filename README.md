## About Osody Studios

* Osody studios is a design agency that specializes in web design and other graphical elements like logos and animations!

* Originally started in mid-pandemic 2020 as just a side project to earn a little extra cash, my freelance-agency was
slowly growing with expertise and people to provide my clients with top-of-the-line services.

I built [osody.se](https://osody.se/) with pure sass/scss, typeScript and HTML alongside with some awesome graphic-element tools. I take pleasure in creating websites from scratch as I believe that relying solely on pre-existing frameworks like Bootstrap can lead to a lack of originality and limit the potential for innovation. By eschewing such frameworks, I endeavor to craft distinctive and unique websites that provide a superior user experience and set themselves apart from the competition.

## Tools
